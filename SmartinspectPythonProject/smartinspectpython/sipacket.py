    Abstract base class for all packets in the SmartInspect library.

    This class is the base class for all packets in the SmartInspect
    library. The following table lists the available packets
    together with a short description.
    
    Packet             | Description
    -----------------  | ---------------------------------------------------------------------  
    ControlCommand     | Responsible for administrative tasks like clearing the Console.
    LogEntry           | Represents the most important packet in the entire SmartInspect concept. Is used for the majority of logging methods in the SISession class.
    LogHeader          | Responsible for storing and transferring log metadata. Used by the SIPipeProtocol and SITcpProtocol classes to support the filter and trigger functionality of the SmartInspect Router service application.
    ProcessFlow        | Responsible for managing thread and process information about your application.
    Watch              | Responsible for handling variable watches.
    
    Threadsafety:
        This class and sub-classes are not guaranteed to be thread-safe.
        To ensure thread-safety, use ThreadSafe as well as the Lock and
        Unlock methods.
