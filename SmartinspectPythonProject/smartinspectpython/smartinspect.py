class SmartInspect:
    """
    The SmartInspect class is the most important class in the SmartInspect Python3 library. An instance of this class is able
    to write log messages to a file or to send them directly to the SmartInspect Console using TCP. You can control these
    connections by setting the Connections property. 
    
    The SmartInspect class offers several properties for controlling the logging behavior. Besides the Connections property there
    is the Enabled property which controls if log messages should be sent or not. Furthermore, the AppName property specifies the
    application name displayed in the SmartInspect Console. And last but not least, we have the Level and DefaultLevel properties
    which specify the log level of an SmartInspect object and its related sessions.
    
    Additionally, the SmartInspect class acts as parent for sessions, which contain the actual logging methods, like, for
    example, SISession.LogMessage or SISession.LogObject. It is possible and common that several different sessions have the same parent
    and thus share the same connections. The SISession class contains dozens of useful methods for logging any kind of data. Sessions
    can even log variable watches, generate illustrated process and thread information or control the behavior of the SmartInspect
    Console. It is possible, for example, to clear the entire log in the Console by calling the SISession.ClearLog method.
    
    To accomplish these different tasks the SmartInspect concept uses several different packets. The SmartInspect class manages these
    packets and logs them to its connections. It is possibility to register event handlers for every packet type which are called
    after a corresponding packet has been sent.
    
    The error handling in the SmartInspect Python3 library is a little bit different than in other libraries. This library uses
    an event, the Error event, for reporting errors. We've chosen this way because a logging framework should not alter the behavior
    of an application by firing exceptions. The only exception you need to handle can be thrown by the Connections property if the
    supplied SmartInspect.Connections contains errors.
    
    Threadsafety:
        This class is fully thread-safe.

                Invalid syntax, unknown protocols or inexistent options.
        
        You can set multiple connections by separating the connections with commas. A connection consists of a protocol
        identifier like "file" plus optional protocol parameters in parentheses. If you, for example, want to log to a file, the
        Connections property must be set to "file()". You can specify the filename in the parentheses after the protocol identifier
        like this: "file(filename=\\"c:\\mylogfile.sil\\")". Please note that if the Enabled property is set to true, the connections
        try to connect to their destinations immediately. By default, no connections are used.

        See the SIProtocol class for a list of available protocols and SIProtocolFactory for a way to add your own custom protocols.
        Furthermore have a look at the LoadConnections and LoadConfiguration methods, which can load a connections string from a file. 
        Also, for a class which assists in building connections strings, please refer to the documentation of the SIConnectionsBuilder class.

        To automatically replace placeholders in the given connections string, you can use so called connection variables. Please
        have a look at the SetVariable method for more information.

        Please note that an SIInvalidConnectionsException exception is thrown if an invalid connections string is supplied.

        Additionally, every SISession class method evaluates if its parent is enabled and returns immediately if this is not the case.

    def LoadConfiguration(self, fileName:str) -> None:
        """
        Loads the properties and sessions of this SmartInspect instance
        from a configuration file.

        Args:
            fileName (str):
                The name of the file to load the configuration from.
        
        This method loads the properties and sessions of this SmartInspect object from a file. This file should be a plain
        text file containing key/value pairs. Each key/value pair is expected to be on its own line. Empty, unrecognized lines and
        lines beginning with a ';' character are ignored.

        The Error event is used to notify the caller if an error occurs while trying to load the configuration from the
        specified file. Such errors include I/O errors like trying to open a file which does not exist, for example.

        The Error event is also used if the specified configuration file contains an invalid connections string. In this case, an
        instance of the SIInvalidConnectionsException exception type is passed to the Error event.

        Calling this method with the fileName parameter set to null has no effect.

        This method is useful for loading the properties and sessions of this SmartInspect instance after the deployment of an
        application. A typical use case for this method is the following scenario: imagine a customer who needs to send a log file to
        customer service to analyze a software problem. If the software in question uses this LoadConfiguration method, the customer
        service just needs to send a prepared configuration file to the customer. Now, to load the SmartInspect properties from a
        file, the customer now just needs to drop this file to the application's installation directory or any other predefined location.

        To monitor a SmartInspect configuration file for changes, please have a look at the SIConfigurationTimer class.

        To automatically replace placeholders in a loaded connections string, you can use so called connection variables. Please
        have a look at the SetVariable method for more information.

        The following table lists the recognized configuration values, the corresponding SmartInspect properties and their types:

        Value         |  Property (Type)
        --------------|  ------------------------
        appname       |  AppName (string)
        connections   |  Connections (string)
        defaultlevel  |  DefaultLevel (SILevel)
        enabled       |  Enabled (bool)
        level         |  Level (SILevel)

        In addition to these properties, this method also configures any stored sessions of this SmartInspect object. Sessions that
        have been stored or will be added with the AddSession method will be configured with the properties of the related session
        entry of the passed configuration file. Please see the example section for details on how sessions entries look like.

        If no entries can be found in the configuration file for a newly added session, this session will use the default session
        properties. The default session properties can also be specified in the configuration file. Please note that the
        session defaults do not apply to the main session SIAuto.Main since this session has already been added before a
        configuration file can be loaded. The session defaults only apply to newly added sessions and do not affect existing sessions.

        The case of the configuration properties doesn't matter. This means, it makes no difference if you specify 'defaultlevel'
        or 'DefaultLevel' as key, for example.

        For a typical configuration file, please see the example below.

        To support Unicode strings, both the LoadConnections and LoadConfiguration methods are capable of auto-detecting the
        string encoding if a BOM (Byte Order Mark) is given at the start of the file. The following table lists the supported
        encodings and the corresponding BOM identifiers.

        Encoding               | BOM identifier
        -------------------    | ---------------
        UTF8                   | 0xEF, 0xBB, 0xBF
        Unicode                | 0xFF, 0xFE
        Unicode big-endian     | 0xFE, 0xFF
        
        If no BOM is given, the text is assumed to be in the ASCII format. If the configuration file has been created or edited
        with the SmartInspect Configuration Builder, the file always has a UTF8 Byte Order Mark and Unicode strings are therefore
        handled automatically.

        **Example:**
        ``` python
        ; specify the SmartInspect properties.
        connections = file(filename=c:\\log.sil)
        enabled = true
        level = verbose
        defaultlevel = message
        appname = client

        sessiondefaults.level = message
        sessiondefaults.colorbg = 0xffff7f
        
        ; configure some individual sessions.
        session.main.level = verbose
        session.client.active = true
        session.client.colorbg = 0x7fffff

        Empty, unrecognized lines and lines beginning with a ';' character are ignored. This version of the method enables
        logging automatically.

        The Error event is used to notify the application if the specified file cannot be opened or does not contain a
        connection string.  The Connections and Enabled properties of this instance are not changed if such an error occurs.

        The Error event is also used if a connections string could be read but is found to be invalid. In this case, an instance of
        the SIInvalidConnectionsException exception type is passed to the Error event.

        If this doNotEnable parameter is set to true, the Enabled property is not changed. Otherwise this SmartInspect
        instance will be enabled. Calling this method with the fileName parameter set to null has no effect.

        Adds a new or updates an existing connection variable.
        
        Args:
            key (str):
                The key of the connection variable.
            value (str):
                The value of the connection variable.

        This method sets the value of a given connection variable.
        A connection variable is a placeholder for strings in the
        SmartInspect.Connections property. When
        setting a connections string (or loading it from a file
        with LoadConfiguration), any variables which have previously
        been defined with SetVariable are automatically replaced
        with their respective values.

        The variables in the connections string are expected to
        have the following form: $variable$.

        If a connection variable with the given key already exists,
        its value is overridden. To delete a connection variable,
        use UnsetVariable. This method does nothing if the key
        or value argument is null.

        Connection variables are especially useful if you load a
        connections string from a file and would like to handle
        some protocol options in your application instead of the
        configuration file.

        For example, if you encrypt log files, you probably do not
        want to specify the encryption key directly in your
        configuration file for security reasons. With connection
        variables, you can define a variable for the encryption
        key with SetVariable and then reference this variable in
        your configuration file. The variable is then automatically
        replaced with the defined value when loading the
        configuration file.

        Another example deals with the directory or path of a log
        file. If you include a variable in the path of your log
        file, you can later replace it in your application with
        the real value. This might come in handy if you want to
        write a log file to an environment specific value, such
        as an application data directory, for example.
